# microsoft-pdb
This repo contains information from Microsoft about the PDB (Program Database) 
[Symbol File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363368(v=vs.85).aspx) format.

The PDB format has not been officially documented, presenting a challenge for other compilers and
toolsets (such as Clang/LLVM) that want to work with Windows or the Visual Studio debugger. We want
to help the Open Source compilers to get onto the Windows platform.
 
The majority of content on this repo is presented as actual source files from the VC++ compiler 
toolset. Source code is the ultimate documentation :-) We hope that you will find it useful and helpful. If you 
find that you need other information to successfully complete your project, please enter an
[Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-pdb/issues) letting us know what information you need. Thanks :-)
